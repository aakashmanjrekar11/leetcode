## Problem - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
---

## Thought Process -
Start from the ends of the string and swap the pair as we increment left pointer and decrement right pointer

---
## Solution -

```python
class Solution:
  def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
    l = 0
    r = len(s) - 1

    while l < r:
      s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
      l += 1
      r -= 1
```

-   **Time:** O(n)
-    **Space:** O(1)
